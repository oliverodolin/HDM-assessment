# HDM-assessment
exploratory data analysis of MIMIC-III clinical database.

## Project Overview
The details of the assignment are specified in HDM_assessment_guidelines.pdf.
Essentially, the task was to answer questions about groups of patients by pulling information from the MIMIC-III database using SQL, analyse and visualise that data using R, and then put those figures together into a final written report.

The SQL code used to pull information from the database is in SQL_code.sql. The data pulled with this code is stored in csv files in the data folder, further split up into subfolders organised by which assessment question the data was used to answer.

The R code used to analyse and visualise the data is in R_code.Rmd. The tables and figures generated with this code are stored in the figures folder.

The final report is Report.pdf.
